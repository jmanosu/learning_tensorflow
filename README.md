# Learning Tensorflow

A collection of machine learning programs using TFLean which is an abstracted version of Tensorflow.

## Projects

digit_identifier - Classifies hand drawn pictures of digits (NOT FINISHED)

GYM - Graphical machine learning mini-projects

linear_finder - first ML project, finds m and b  of a line given a set of points

random - random projects that I plan to add

## Built With

* [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) - Machine Learning Program used
* [TFlearn](http://tflearn.org/) - Abstracted version of Tensorflow
* [Python](https://www.python.org/) - Programming language used

## Authors

* **Jared Tence** - *Programmed it* - [Github](https://github.com/jmanosu)

## Acknowledgments

* It was fun learning how machine learning works and how data influences the end result of nerual networks
